The pair of legs that carried him were rickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat to the left of a straight line.  
He occasionally gave a smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not thinking of anything in particular.  
An empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm, the nap of his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off.
Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare, who, as he rode, hummed a wandering tune."""
